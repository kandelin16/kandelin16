## Hi, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹

Happy you stopped by! Here's what you should know about me:
- I'm a 2nd Year master's student at BYU ðŸ“š
- I'm part of [Sandbox](https://creators.byu.edu/sandbox/sandbox), a VC led startup incubator for class credit at BYU ðŸš€
- Since 2022 I've been the founder of [FarmHand](https://www.farmhand.pro), seasonal HR made simple ðŸšœ
- After graduating I will start my career in a rotational engineering program at Apple ï£¿

When not coding, I like backpacking, going dancing, reading, and playing the piano.
